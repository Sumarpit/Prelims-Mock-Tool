    "explanation": "Option a is the correct answer.  \n<br><br><b>Statement I is correct</b>. Classical Western  Liberalism places individual liberty at the centre . It is rooted in the idea of \ntolerance and the freedom of thought, expression and action. Thinkers like John Locke  argued that individuals \npossess certain natural rights such as life, liberty and property  even before the formation of any government. John \nStuart Mill  further emphasised that individuals should be free to act according to their own will as long as their \nactions do not cause harm to others. Hence, classical Western liberalism emphasises the pr imacy of individual \nrights over social justice.  \nHowever, the Indian Constitution seeks to achieve a balance between individual rights in Part III and the goals of \nsocial justice reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy. This balancing approach  is also seen in the \nreasonable restrictions placed on fundamental rights in order to promote equality, welfare and social order.  \n<br><br><b>Statement II is incorrect</b>. Secularism refers to the separation of religion from the State. It means that the state shall \nnot f avor or promote any particular religion. The Indian Constitution mandates that the Indian State is secular. The \nPreamble also declares India to be a secular nation.  \nThe Western idea of secularism connotes a complete separation between religion and the stat e. Western \nconception of secularism means mutual exclusion of state and religion in order to protect  values such as individual \nfreedom and citizenship rights of individuals. Mutual exclusion means that religion and state must be strictly \nseparated. \nIndian secularism is fundamentally different from Western secularism.  \nIndian Constitution embodies the positive concept of secularism, i.e. giving equal respect to all religions. Separation \nin India does not mean mutual exclusion.  The state can interfere in the a ffairs of religion, for example to eradicate \nuntouchability. Indian secularism is compatible with the idea of state -supported religious reforms.",

    "explanation": "Option b is the correct answer .  \nTo be recognised as a State in political theory, an entity must exhibit a basic structure that allows it to govern \neffectively and maintain its identity on the global stage . While modern States may differ in size, form of government, \nor political ideology, certain features remain absolutely non -negotiable for statehood.  \nOption I is correct . A State cannot exist in air or imagination; it needs a clearly demarcated geographical area over \nwhich it exercises legal and political authority . This territory can be vast like Russia or small like San Marino, but it \nmust be identifiable and enforceable. Without land, there is no jurisdiction or scope for governance.  \nOption II is correct . The very idea of a State is built around people, citizens who  are governed and who participate \nin governance . The size or composition of the population doesn\u2019t affect statehood. What matters is that there is a \nsettled community to form the State's social foundation. Even a small number, as long as it is stable and r ecognisable, \nfulfils this criterion.  \nOption III is correct . A government is the operational arm of the State.  It is the agency through which laws are \nmade, policies implemented, and order maintained. Whether it\u2019s a democracy or monarchy, parliamentary or \npresidential, the form does not matte r. What matters is the existence of an authority that enforces rules and \ndecisions. A State without a government would be reduced to chaos and power struggles.  \nOption IV is correct . Sovereignty is the most crucial featur e of the State amongst all.  Sovereignty means supreme \npower, internally to make decisions without interference, and externally to be free from the control of any other \nState. India, before gaining independence in 1947, had people, territory, and a governme nt, but lacked sovereignty, \nhence, it was not considered a State. Sovereignty gives a State its independent legal identity.  \nOption V is incorrect . While being recognised by other States adds diplomatic legitimacy, it is not an essential \nfeature of statehoo d in political theory . A State may exist effectively even if not recognised universally. For example, \nTaiwan functions as a sovereign State in all practical terms, though it is not formally recognised by many countries \ndue to geopolitical reasons..  \nOption VI is incorrect . A written Constitution is not an essential feature of a State.  While many countries like India \nhave a written constitution that codifies rights and powers, it is not a prerequisite for statehood. The United Kingdom, \nfor example, functions without a single written constitution and is still a fully sovereign State. A constitution may help \norganise the government, but its presence or absence does not define whether an entity is a State or not.  \nSource: https://nios.ac.in/media/documents/srsec317newE/317EL2.pdf  - Page 19 \nMastering Indian Polity by Forum IAS, 1st Edition, Chapter 1 :  \u2013 Basic Concepts, Page: 1 -3",

    "explanation": "Option a is the correct answer .  \nCitizenship is one of the foundational concepts of political life. It defines the legal bond between an individual and the \nState and determines who enjoys full membership in a political community. The Indian Con stitution, while laying \ndown the initial provisions for citizenship, also empowers Parliament to legislate further on this matter.  \n<br><br><b>Statement I is correct</b>. The provisions related to citizenship in India are located in Part II of the Constitution , \nspecifical ly from Articles 5 to 11 . These articles dealt with the status of citizenship at the time of commencement of \nthe Constitution in 1950 . For example, they laid down who would be considered a citizen at independence, including \npersons domiciled in India and t hose migrating from Pakistan. While the Constitution initially covered only these \ntransitional cases, Parliament was authorised under Article 11 to make laws on citizenship  for the future. <br><br><b>Thus,</b> the \nCitizenship Act of 1955  was enacted, and it has been amen ded multiple times since then to address evolving \nchallenges.  \n<br><br><b>Statement II is incorrect</b> . If a foreign territory becomes part of India, the Government of India can issue an order  \n(published in the Official Gazette) deciding who from that territory will beco me Indian citizens , based on their \nconnection to that place. These people will be treated as Indian citizens from the date mentioned in the order. Eg:  \nWhen Pondicherry joined India, the Government issued the Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order, 1962  under the \nCitizenship Act, 1955. This order made the people of Pondicherry Indian citizens from the specified date.  \nThis broader framework reflects both India's sovereign authority and its evolving legal structure.  \nStatement III is incorrect. As per Section 9 of th e Citizenship Act, 1955, if any Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the \ncitizenship of another country, he or she automatically loses Indian citizenship.  \n\u25cf Here the keyword is voluntarily which means that if an Indian citizen consciously, knowingly, and without any \nduress, undue influence, or compulsion, obtains citizenship of another country, they will no longer be \nconsidered an Indian citizen. <br><br><b>Thus,</b> unless it is voluntarily he/she does not automatically ceases to be an \nIndian citizen.  \n\u25cf Also, there is an exception to section 9 of the Act as it shall not apply to a citizen of India who, during any war \nin which India may be engaged, voluntarily acquires, the citizenship of another country, until the Central \nGovernment otherwise directs. <br><br><b>Thus,</b> he/she doesnot automatically ceases to be an Indian citizen.  \nKnowledge Base:  \nAcquisition of Citizenship:  \nS.

While most democracies including India, the USA, and South Afric a etc. have adopted \nwritten constitutions, some successful democracies function without one. For example, the United Kingdom  is a well -\nfunctioning democratic State , yet it does not have a single written Constitution. Instead, it relies on conventions, \njudicial decisions, statutes, and other historical documents  (e.g., Magna Carta, Bill of Rights 1689) to govern \ndemocratic life. Despite this, it operates as a stable, mature democracy  with regular elections, rule of law, and \nseparation of powers. <br><br><b>Thus,</b> while a written Constitution is desirable and provides clarity, it is not essential  for a \ndemocracy.  \n<br><br><b>Statement II is correct</b>. A written Constitution is valuable in a democracy because it helps in limiting the power of \nthe government . It defines the scope of aut hority, outlines the duties of various organs of the State, and most \nimportantly, safeguards the rights of citizens . In the Indian context, this limitation is ensured through:  \n\u25cf Fundamental Rights  (Part III),  \n\u25cf Directive Principles of State Policy  (Part IV),  \n\u25cf Checks and balances between the legislature, executive, and judiciary , and  \n\u25cf Judicial review  by the Supreme Court and High Courts.  \nThese provisions make it difficult for any ruling party or leader to arbitrarily alter the basic structure or suppress \nfreedoms. <br><br><b>Thus,</b> a written Constitution acts as a legal shield against authoritarian drift  in a democracy.  \nSource: https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?hess3=1-8  \u2013 Why Does a Country Need a Constitution? -P age 5  \nMastering Indian Polity by Forum IAS, 1st Edition, Chapter - 2 Constitution of India Page: 10",

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Option d is the correct answer.  \nThe parliamentary system of government is a form of governance in which the executive and legislative branches are \nclosely linked. The primary reason for India to adopt the Parliamentary form of government is that the e xecutive is \ndrawn from the legislature and remains responsible and accountable to it for its actions and policies.   \nIn this system, the real executive (the cabinet or council of ministers) is legally and immediately answerable to the \nlegislature, usually t o its popularly elected lower house, for the conduct of government affairs and formulation of \npolicies. This ensures continuous legislative control over the executive and upholds the principle of collective \nresponsibility.  \nOption a is incorrect:  India adop ted the principle of separation of powers in a flexible manner which ensures the \nindependent functioning among the different organs of the government. Whereas the parliamentary  system \nprovides the fusion of executive and legislature , not separation.  \nOption  b is incorrect: Any democratic system whether parliamentary or presidential allows citizens to directly \nelect their representatives  to the legislature. Hence enabling the people of India to have a direct role in electing their \nrepresentatives is not a uni que feature of this form of government.  \nOption c is incorrect: India does not follow the model of full parliamentary sovereignty as practiced in the United \nKingdom.

    "explanation": "Option a is the correct answer.  \nIn a federal system, power is divided between two or more levels of government, such as the central and state \ngovernments. Unlike a unitary system, where the central authority can issue orders to subordinate units, in a \nfederation,  the central government cannot command the state governments. Each level of government has powers of \nits own and is independently answerable to the people.  \nOption I is incorrect: In a unitary system, all citizens owe allegiance to only one central governme nt. India follows \nthis,  meaning a person is a citizen of India, not separately a citizen of their specific State. A federal country, like \nthe USA, typically has dual citizenship (State and Federal).   \nOption II is correct: An independent judiciary is a core  federal feature. The Supreme Court has the authority to \ninterpret the Constitution and adjudicate disputes between the Union and the States.  This judicial mechanism \nensures that neither level of government exceeds its powers, maintaining the federal struc ture.  \nOptions III and IV are incorrect:  The Appointment of Governors  and Emergency Provisions  are unitary features  of \nthe Indian Constitution as they strengthen central control over the states . Governors are appointed by the President . \nGovernor also have discretionary powers , such as reserving bills for the President and recommending President\u2019s \nRule, which enhance Union\u2019s influence.

While all democratic \ncountries hold elections, many non -democratic regimes also conduct elections. <br><br><b>Therefore,</b> certain minimum \nconditions must be met for an election to b e genuinely democratic  \nOption I is correct:  In a democracy, political equality is a core principle i.e. every adult citizen must have one vote, \nand each vote must carry equal value.

Such practices violate the democratic principle of \u201cone person, one \nvote, one value.\u201d  \nOption II is correct:  In a democracy, the government is required to function within the limits defined by the \nCons titution and citizens\u2019 rights, upholding the principle of the rule of law . <br><br><b>Thus,</b> the state must respect and \nprotect the fundamental rights of its citizens.

It aimed to gradually introduce responsible government . \nStatement I  is correct.  The Act introduced responsible government at provincial level  by making Indian ministers \naccountable to the provincial legislative councils  for certain areas of administration (transferred subjects). However, \nthis responsibility was partial and restricted. Responsibility was limited because the Gover nor retained overriding \npowers , and not all subjects were under Indian ministers.  \n<br><br><b>Statement II is correct</b>.  The Act introduced diarchy (dual government)  at the provincial level, and categorized \nprovincial subjects into \u201ctransferred\u201d  and \u201creserved\u201d  lists. Transferred subjects (e.g., education, health, local self -\ngovernment) were administered by Indian ministers who were responsible to the provincial legislature. Reserved \nsubjects (e.g., law and order, finance, revenue) were handled by the Governor a nd his executive council, who were not \nresponsible to the legislature.  \nStatement II explains Statement I: Statement -II provides the reason why responsible government was introduced \nonly in a limited sense \u2014because ministers were responsible only for transfe rred subjects, while reserved subjects \nremained under the Governor.",

Under a Republic form, the Head of \nthe State, single or collective,  is always elected for a prescribed period.

It recognises that some limits on \npersonal behaviour are necessary to maintain social order and ensure that one person\u2019s actions do not harm the well -\nbeing of others.

In the constitutional provisions in India, the term used for such justifiable constraints is \n\u2018reasonable restrictions\u2019. The restrictions may be there but they must be reasonable, i.e., ca pable of being defended by \nreason, not excessive, not out of proportion to the action being restricted, since then it would impinge on the general \ncondition of freedom in society.  \nAs positive liberty recognises that some limits on personal behaviour are n ecessary to maintain social order  and \nensure that one person\u2019s actions do not harm the well -being of others.

Thus Statement II explains Statement I.  \nStatement III is corr ect and explains Statement I:  In India, the  State facilitates the realization of certain rights and \nopportunities.  Some of the constitutional provisions, like the Fundamental Rights, exemplify this commitment, aiming \nto preserve and promote various facets of liberty.  \nAs positive liberty refers to the freedom that comes from having the right conditions \u2014 such as supportive laws, social \nnorms, and opportunities \u2014that allow individuals to develop themselves fully. <br><br><b>Thus,</b> in the Indian Constituion the ethos \nof po sitive liberty is embedded.

The \nexistence of the \u2018minimum area of noninterference\u2019 is the recognition that human nature and human dignity need \nan area where the person can act unobstructed by others.  \n\u25cf Negative liberty tradition argues for an inviolable area of non -interference in whi ch the individual can express \nhimself or herself.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Option b is the correct answer .  \nA Constitution  is not just a legal document but the moral backbone and political foundation  of a country. It outlines \nhow a nation should be governed and protects its  citizens from arbitrary rule.  \nOption a is incorrect. While a Constitution may establish the separation of powers (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary), \nthis separation is rarely complete.  Most modern Constitutions adopt a system of checks and balances where  organs \noverlap and limit each other, rather than existing in absolute isolation.  \nOption b is correct. The Constitution reflects the shared values and aspirations  of its citizens. It defines what kind of \nsociety people wish to live in like democratic, incl usive, secular, and just. This gives moral and political identity  to the \ncitizens of a country.  \nOption c is incorrect.  While the Constitution may direct the State to strive for economic equality through \ninstruments like the Directive Principles of State Po licy, it does not guarantee equal distribution of wealth and \nresources . Economic distribution is subject to policies, budgets, and practical governance measures. The \nConstitution provides the framework and goals , not the guarantees of equal economic outcom es. \nOption d is incorrect.  The Constitution creates the framework  (e.g., the Election Commission) and the rules to enable  \nfree and fair elections, but it does not and cannot guarantee  that the outcomes of every single election will be entirely \nfree from disputes or always perceived as perfectly fair.  \nKnowledge Base:  \n\n \n \nForum  Learning Centre : Delhi - Plot No. 36, 4th Floor (Above Kalyan Jewellers), Pusa Road, Karol Bagh, New  Delhi - 110005   | Patna - 2nd floor, AG Palace, E Boring  \nCanal Road, Patna, Bihar 800001   | Hyderabad - 1st & 2nd Floor, SM Plaza, RTC  X Rd, Indira Park Road, Jawahar Nagar, Hyderabad, Telangana 500020 \n9311740400, 9311740900 | https://academy.forumias.com  | admissions@forumias.academy  | helpdesk@forumias.academy  \n \n \n \nSource: https://ncert.nic.in/textbook/pdf/keps201.pdf  - Chapter: Constitution: Why and How?",

    "explanation": "Option b is the correct answer.  \nThe Supreme Court of India , established under Article 124  of the Constitution, is the apex judicial body  in the \ncountry. It came into existence on 26 January 1950  with the enforcement of the Constitution. It ensures the rule of \nlaw, protects fundamental rights , and settles disputes between the Union and States. Its decisions are binding on all \ncourts across India.  \n<br><br><b>Statement I is correct</b>: The Supreme Court of India is the custodian of the Constitution. It safeguards the supremacy \nof the Constitution by exercising the power of judicial review , ensuring that no law or executive action violates \nconstitutional provisions or fundamental rights.  \n<br><br><b>Statement II is correct</b>: The Indian Constitution establishes a single, integrated judicial system  with the Supreme \nCourt at its apex. Unlike federal countries such as the USA, India has one unified hierarchy of courts  i.e. district courts \nat the base, High Courts in the middle, and the Supreme Court at the top covering both central and state laws.  \nStatement II does not explain Statement I:  The single  unified judicial structure  in India, with  the Supreme Court  at \nits top dem onstrates the structure of the Judicial system in India. It provides continuity in judicial proceedings and \nprovides for uniform interpretation of the laws and the  provisions in both the constitutional and  other legal matters in \nthe country. It signifies t hat the decisions and interpretations of the higher courts act as precedents for the lower \ncourts in the country.  \nWhereas the Supreme Court acting as custodian of the constitution,  infers that it is the duty of the court to protect \nthe spirit and basic str ucture of the constitution from any infringement by the executive and legislative actions.  It \ncan be said to be derived from the provisions under  Article 13, which gives the Supreme Court the power of Judicial \nreview and Power of Supreme Court under Articl e 32 of the constitution to issue writs in case of infringement of the \nfundamental rights. Similarly, Article 142 of the Indian Constitution grants the Supreme Court the unique power to \npass any decree or order to ensure \"complete justice\" in any case, eve n if existing laws are silent or inadequate, \nallowing it to fill legislative gaps, create guidelines and direct executive actions. There are several other tools at the \nhand of the Supreme Court like, Special Leave Petition and Public Interest Litigation.

It ensures that the State functions within the framework of fundamental law , exercising its powers \nonly to achieve the aspirations of the people  and the broader objectives of s ociety . \nOption I is correct: Rule of Law  is fundamental to constitutionalism . It ensures that no individual or institution, \nincluding the government, is above the law .

    "explanation": "Option a is the correct answer.  \nAfter India\u2019s independence in 1947, the country inherited a complex mix of British provinces and princely states , \nleading to significant administrative and linguistic challenges. The demand for reorganizing states on linguistic and \nadministrative lines  gained momentum, especially from southern regions. To address these concerns, the \nGovernment of India appointed a s eries of committees and commissions  between 1948 and 1953. The correct \nchronology is as follows:  \nI. S.K. Dhar Commission (1948)  was the first committee  appointed by the Constituent Assembly in June 1948  to \nexamine the issue of state reorganization  in newly  independent India. It was headed by Justice S.K. Dhar . The \ncommission submitted its report in December 1948 and recommended the reorganisation of states on the basis of \nadministrative convenience rather than linguistic factor.  \nIII. Soon after the Dhar Com mission had submitted its report, the Indian National Congress appointed at its Jaipur \nSession in December, 1948, a Committee to consider the question of linguistic provinces and to review the position in \nthe light of the report of the Dar Commission.  The Committee, known as the J.V.P. Committee; which consisted of \nJawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, was the first Congress body to sound a \nnote of warning against the linguistic principle.
